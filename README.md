# ChatGPT-Local
This is a python script to use chatGPT locally on your machine as an application.

## How it works
This script uses the openai library to interact with the Chatbot API, and the tkinter library to create a simple GUI.

To use this script, you will need to sign up for an OpenAI API key and replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your own API key. You can sign up for an API key and learn more about the Chatbot API at https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completion/create.
